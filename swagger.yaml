  version: 1.0.0
  description: |

    Welcome to the sCORe API. The api consists of multiple high-performance RESTful JSON endpoints that can be used to fetch the data about performance and reputation of different chainlink oracles.  
      
    We have client libraries in [python](https://github.com/securedatalinks/reputation-score-python-client),[golang](https://github.com/securedatalinks/reputation-score-golang-client) and [nodejs](https://github.com/securedatalinks/reputation-score-js-client) generated from [swagger file](#TODO)! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.  
      
      
    # Quick Start Guide  
    ```shell  
      curl -X POST -d "from=9870454" -d "to=9877754" -d "oracle_url=0xB0Cf943Cf94E7B6A2657D15af41c5E06c2BFEA3D" -H "Authorization: API_KEY" reputation.link/reputation-interval
    ```
      
    For developers eager to start using sCORe API right away, there are 3 quick steps to make.  
      
    1. Sign up for a free API access key on [reputation.link](reputation.link)  
    2. (optional) If you own an oracle, register your oracle on the same page to be able to get more info about your oracle.  
    3. Make a test call using your API key. Check example on the right that fetches all  most up-to-date reputation for SDL oracle;  


    # Authentication  
    > Example using auth in HTTP headers
    > Make sure to replace `API_KEY` with your API key.  
    
    ```shell   
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: API_KEY"  -d "from=1580083200" -d "to=1580183200" -d "oracle_url=0xB0Cf943Cf94E7B6A2657D15af41c5E06c2BFEA3D" reputation.link/reputation-interval
    ```
     
    sCORe uses API keys to allow access to the API. All requests made against the sCORe api must be validated with API key. In order to get API key, you must register at [reputation.link](http://reputation.link).  
      
    API key must be included in all API requests to the server via HTTP header:
    `Authorization: API_KEY`  
      
    # Standards and conventions  
    
    ## Endpoint Response Payload Format 
        
    ```
    {  
      "data" : {
        ...  
      },  
      "status": {  
        "timestamp": "2018-06-06T07:52:27.273Z",  
        "status_code": 400,  
        "error_message": "Invalid value for \"id\"",  
      }  
    }  
    ```
    
    Each endpoint returns data in JSON format with 2 parts, `data` and `status`.  
    A `data` object contains results for request if the call is successful.  
    A `status` object contains the timestamp, when the call was executed and status code and message, indicating if the request was succesfull  
    See [status codes and rate limits](#status-codes-and-rate-limits) for details in different status codes.

    
    ## Versioning  
    The sCORe API is versioned to guarantee new features and updates are non-breaking. The latest version of this API is /V1/.  
    All our API endpoints start with version.  
      
    Backwards compatible updates might be added to API without creating new version. You can check our [Changelog](#Changelog) to see those changes.  
    These updates are considered backwards compatible:  
      
     * Adding new API resources.  
     * Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.  
     * Adding new properties to existing API responses.  
     * Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.  
     * Changing the way some data are computed, while not changing the range of possible values     
          -- e.q. We change the way reputation of oracle is computed, but it's still a value between 1 and 100.  #TODO IS THIS BACKWARD COMPATIBLE?
      
      
    ## Date and Time Formats  
    All endpoints that require date/time parameters allow timestamps to be passed in either `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` (eq.2018-06-22 01:46:40) timestamp format or in Unix time (eg. 1528249600).  
    All timestamps returned in JSON payloads are returned in UTC time using human-readable format which follows this pattern: `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`  
    Data is collected, recorded, and reported in UTC time unless otherwise specified.  
      
    ## Status codes and rate limits  
    Every endpoint always respond with HTTP status code 200 for both succesful requests and failures. The `status` object is always included in the JSON response. This object contains `status_code` and `error_message`.  
    If there was a problem processing the request, one of these status codes is returned.  
      
    Error Code |  Error Message  
    -----------|---------------  
    1000 | Request was succesful  
    1001 | This API Key is invalid.  
    1002 | API key missing.  
    1003 | Invalid request parameters  
    1004 | Your don't have permissions for this call.  
    1005 | This API Key has been disabled. Please contact support.  
    1006 | You've exceeded your API Key's HTTP request rate limit.   
    1007 | You've exceeded your API Key's daily rate limit.  
    1008 | You've exceeded your API Key's monthly rate limit.  
      
    ## Rate limits
    Each key can be used to query our endpoints maximally 30 times per minute.
    

    ## Cache / Update frequency
    All data are updated every 5 minutes.
